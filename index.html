                                        Malaysia. In a tiny town of Mentakab, where I learn
                                        to design and build websites, along with front end programming. I
                                        live in Kuala Lumpur, but due to the pandemic, I am residing in my hometown,
                                        Mentakab.
                                        I hold a degree Softweare Engoneering. Designing & building websites became my
                                        passion in college so I would really like to start my career in it.

                                        A person must start somewhere right? Therefore I am hoping for your company to
                                        give me a chance to kick-off my passion inside the industry.

                                    For this project, I work as the UI developer. My role consists of building the web
                                    pages based on the UI/UX design provided from other teams.

                                <p>The pages were build using angular, where I mostly handle on the HTML, and CSS part.
                                    For each pages, I developed to be mobile responsive, as the main target of the
                                    system is for mobile users in Thailand, specifically for Health Care Personnel that
                                    are involved within Roche Thailand.

                                    Next, for this magazine, I was approached by the team to help and design some characters illustration to accomodate to their article theme: Teen Survival Guide.

                                <p>
                                    For this, it is more to digital artwork related, where I had drawn each illustration to suite their requirement.
                                    Overall, I had provided 7 illustrations for the team.

                                    Other than that, I had also participated in a game competition held by the JomWeb company.
                                    The competition required each participants to build a simple web based game, using only
                                    basic web components, that is, HTML5, CSS3 and preferable Vanilla Javascript. This was also 
                                    my first time building a game using basic web components, and a very nice introduction of the technology in another perspective for me!
                                    Who knew you can use these basic technology to build a game!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As for the development, ofcourse I followed the instructions, asn build a simple 'Google Dinosour Jumping' game as reference.
                                    Ofcourse, there were better games submitted, and I did not win. But, that was some eye opening experience for me.
